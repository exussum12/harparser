# harparser
Parse and extract file from a HAR dump in Chrome

# Dumping files viewed online

Some sites (such as wedpics) allow a full screen slideshow. If you filter the traffic and then save as a har file ([example here](http://patrickhamann.com/workshops/performance/tasks/1_Network/1_2.html))
this library can then parse and extract the media
